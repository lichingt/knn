K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier implementation

The implementation is written in [knn_cars.ipynb](https://github.com/lichingt/knn/blob/main/knn_cars.ipynb) with the following data in use:
- [car.features](https://github.com/lichingt/knn/blob/main/car.features)
- [car.labels](https://github.com/lichingt/knn/blob/main/car.labels)
- [car.names](https://github.com/lichingt/knn/blob/main/car.names)

This classifier has been implemented as part of an assignment in 2022 Semester 2 Introduction to Machine Learning subject at the University of Melbourne, Australia.
